# ND-06.014.02 ND-100 Reference Manual

#### 3.1.2.5 48 Bit Floating Point Word

The standard ND-100 instruction set provides full floating point hardware arithmetic instructions, load floating, store floating, add, subtract, multiply and divide floating, convert floating to integer and convert integer to floating.

The data format of floating point words uses **32 bits for the mantissa**, one bit for sign and **15 bits for biased exponent**.

The mantissa is always normalized, **0.5 ≤ mantissa < 1**. The exponent base is 2, and the exponent is biased with 2¹⁴. A standardized floating zero contains zero in all 48 bits.

In main memory, one floating point data word occupies three 16-bit core locations, which are addressed by the address of the exponent part:

- **n**: exponent and sign  
- **n + 1**: most significant part of mantissa  
- **n + 2**: least significant part of mantissa  

In CPU registers, bits 0–15 of the mantissa are in the **D register**, bits 16–31 in the **A register**, and bits 32–47 (exponent and sign) in the **T register**. These three registers together are defined as the **floating accumulator**.

##### Floating Word Format

The accuracy is 32 bits or approximately 10 decimal digits; any integer up to 232
has an exact floating point representation.


The range is:

$$
2^{-16384} \cdot 0.5 \leq X < 2^{16383} \cdot 1 \quad \text{or} \quad X = 0
$$

or

$$
10^{-4920} < X < 10^{4920}
$$

| +1    | 040001 | 100000 | 0      |
| -1    | 140001 | 100000 | 0      |
